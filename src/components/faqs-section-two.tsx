      question: "What exactly is TrustedApp now?",
      answer:
        "A closed marketplace where Tier-1, VC-backed founders sell razor-sharp product feedback to SaaS teams that need proof before they ship or spend. No coupon codes, no affiliate fluff—just paid insights.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-2",
      question: "How do founders get paid?",
      answer:
        "Accept a brief → record a 2-min review, short survey, or 15-min call → vendor clicks Approve → Stripe drops cash into your account instantly. Payouts are automatic and recurring for any rev-share deals you spark.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-3",
      question: "What do SaaS companies receive?",
      answer:
        "Verified founder opinions you can quote in board decks: usability videos, survey data, live discovery calls, and testimonial clips—all matched to your ICP by our LLM so the noise stays out of your roadmap.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-4",
      question: "Who can join as a founder?",
      answer:
        "Operators who've raised from top-tier VCs and actively use the tools they're reviewing. We verify funding, role, and tech stack; if you're not hands-on with the product category, you're out.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-5",
      question: "How is TrustedApp different from AppSumo or FounderPass?",
      answer:
        "Those sites sell discounted licenses. We sell high-signal feedback loops. Vendors pay you for truth bombs; you don't pay them for lifetime deals. Think user-research turbocharged, not bargain-bin SaaS.",
    },
    {
      id: "item-6",
      question: "Is there a cost to join?",
      answer:
        "Founders: zero. Vendors: choose a monthly plan or buy credits à la carte—cancel anytime. TrustedApp only takes a 10% cut after a vendor approves the work, so everyone's incentives stay aligned.",
    },
