    question: "What exactly is TrustedApp now?",
    answer:
      "A closed marketplace where Tier-1, VC-backed founders sell razor-sharp product feedback to SaaS teams that need proof before they ship or spend. No coupon codes, no affiliate fluff—just paid insights.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do founders get paid?",
    answer:
      "Accept a brief → record a 2-min review, short survey, or 15-min call → vendor clicks Approve → Stripe drops cash into your account instantly. Payouts are automatic and recurring for any rev-share deals you spark.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do SaaS companies receive?",
    answer:
      "Verified founder opinions you can quote in board decks: usability videos, survey data, live discovery calls, and testimonial clips—all matched to your ICP by our LLM so the noise stays out of your roadmap.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who can join as a founder?",
    answer:
      "Operators who've raised from top-tier VCs and actively use the tools they're reviewing. We verify funding, role, and tech stack; if you're not hands-on with the product category, you're out.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is TrustedApp different from AppSumo or FounderPass?",
    answer:
      "Those sites sell discounted licenses. We sell high-signal feedback loops. Vendors pay you for truth bombs; you don't pay them for lifetime deals. Think user-research turbocharged, not bargain-bin SaaS.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a cost to join?",
    answer:
      "Founders: zero. Vendors: choose a monthly plan or buy credits à la carte—cancel anytime. TrustedApp only takes a 10% cut after a vendor approves the work, so everyone's incentives stay aligned.",
  },
